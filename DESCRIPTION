Description: The reliability of clusters is estimated using random projections. 
    A set of stability measures is provided to assess the reliability of the clusters 
    discovered by a generic clustering algorithm. 
    The stability measures are taylored to high dimensional data (e.g. DNA microarray data) 
    (Valentini, G (2005), <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti817>.
