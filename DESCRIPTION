Title: Assessment of cluster stability by randomized maps
Author: Giorgio Valentini <valenti@dsi.unimi.it>
Maintainer: Giorgio Valentini <valenti@dsi.unimi.it>
Depends: stats, MASS
Description: The reliability of clusters is estimated using random projections. A set of stability measures is provided
	to assess the reliability of the clusters discovered by a generic clustering algorithm. 
	The stability measures are taylored to high dimensional data (e.g. DNA microarray data).
